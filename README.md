# Hi ðŸ‘‹

25, studying Media Informatics at Ulm University.  

Interests:  
- CLI scripts
- Getting temp-blocked by Cloudflare because I set a variable to `1000` instead of `10`
- Languages with pointers (`&` and `*` make me feel fancy)
- Abusing badly secured or badly designed API's with no rate-limit
- General content crawlers/archivers
- Graphics programming
- abusing GPU's with ethically questionable software
- async programming
- REST-API's
- Chrome-Extensions
- General WebDev stuff (except CSS, fuck CSS!)
- Academic Metadata
- ffmpeg

Languages/Frameworks I know: 
- `golang`
- `React/Typescript/Javascript/Material-UI/MobX`
- `java`
- `C++/OpenGL/NDI` (not very proficient)


Things I want to learn:
- `rust`
- `cuda` (I payed 450â‚¬ for my GPU, better use its full potential)
- `dotnet/C#`
- `DevOPS` CI/CD
- `azure` (still have student credit...)

Currently working on/getting payed for: 
- `pub-manager`: publication management system for the [university website](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mi/mi-forschung/viscom/publikationen)
- `ndi-viewer`: streaming desktop output to a cluster of pc's using [NDI](https://www.ndi.tv/) based off [viscom-core](https://github.com/viscom-ulm/viscom_framework)
